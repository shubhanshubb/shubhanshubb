### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is SHUBHANSHU BARNWAL , and I am a passionate MERN Full Stack Web Developer currently employed at Midknight Studio Pvt Ltd. I wanted to take a moment to introduce myself and share some information about my background and skills.

In terms of programming languages, I have a strong command over C, C++, JAVA and JavaScript. This versatile skill set allows me to tackle a wide range of challenges, both on the front end and the back end of web development projects. On the front end, I am experienced in crafting engaging user experiences using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and framework like ReactJS, React Native, NextJS, Tailwind CSS . This ensures that the websites I work on are not only functional but also visually appealing and intuitive.

When it comes to the back end, I am well-versed in working with MongoDB, which allows me to efficiently manage and structure the databases that power web applications. Additionally, my familiarity with cloud practices adds another layer of proficiency to my skill set.

I have hands-on experience with Git, Bash, and Jira, enabling me to streamline the development process and ensure smooth collaboration within development teams. I am also a dedicated cloud enthusiast with a strong interest in Amazon Web Services (AWS). Cloud computing has revolutionized the way we deploy and manage applications, and I am excited about leveraging AWS services to build scalable and reliable solutions.
