With a full-stack approach, I build intuitive digital experiences across **web and mobile** using foundational technologies like **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**, and frameworks such as **ReactJS** and **Tailwind CSS**. My development workflow is streamlined by tools such as **Git**, **GitHub**, **Bash**, **SQL**, and **Socket.io**, and I'm well-versed in agile project management and the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**.

ðŸš€ One of my proudest accomplishments is publishing multiple apps on the **App Store** and **Google Play Store**, a testament to my ability to deliver polished, user-centric products that make a meaningful impact.

I am deeply passionate about **cloud computing**, particularly leveraging **AWS** and **Firebase**, to build scalable backend infrastructure and enable real-time capabilities.
